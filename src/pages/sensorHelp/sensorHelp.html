      <h2 text-center>Presence Value</h2>
        <ion-item text-wrap>
            <p text-center>detected - not detected</p>The presence sensors are passive infrared sensors (PIR). They are mounted on the ceiling 
            in the middle of the room. They detect motion in an angle of 110 degree.

        <h2 text-center>Air Quality</h2>
        <ion-item text-wrap>
            <p text-center>0 - 100% best at 100% </p>The gas sensor measures humidity and gas concentration. We calculate a so-called IAQ - 
            Indoor Air Quality index value scaled from 0-100% (where 100% is best). The index is comprised up to 25% is determined
             by Humidity levels and the remaining 75% by Gas concentrations. Humidity is universally accepted as being optimal when it is 40% 
             within a reading range of 0 to 100%. At 40% humidity the index contribution will be 0%, but at a Humidity reading of 0%, the 
             contribution increases to 25% and similarly at 100% it contributes 25% to the index.
            The gas concentration is based on a baseline measured under optimal conditions (ventilated room), which has to be set manually 
            therefor the results may variate.

        <h2 text-center>Noise Level</h2>
        <ion-item text-wrap>
            <p text-center>0 - 100% best at 0% </p>The noise sensor measures sound waves in percentages of maximum calibration in average 
            of 3 seconds. 100% is the loudest, 0% is quietest. Each sensor has to be calibrated manually therefor the results may variate. 
            You can assume that 100%  correspond to about 100 decibel.
